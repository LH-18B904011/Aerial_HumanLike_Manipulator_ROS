# Aerial_HumanLike_Manipulator_ROS
this manipulator is intended to be attached to the drone. it's characterized as a human-like and can do many tasks similar to those done by a human but mobility in the space.
this project was implemented in reality and controlled by a ni MyRIO board using LabVIEW robotics module. now this project here is the simulation by 
a ROS "Robot Operating System" including Gazebo Control, Gazebo, RViz and so on.
